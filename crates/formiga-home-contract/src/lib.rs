//! The household contract between Formiga Desktop and Formiga Home.
//!
//! Formiga Desktop owns the living colony. When its owner clicks a house in the village, Desktop
//! writes a [`HomeSnapshot`] of the household that lives there, and a copy of the Home layouts it
//! keeps, into a fresh session directory, and starts Home with that directory's path. The snapshot
//! is a deliberate projection of one household, written for this purpose alone: it is never the
//! colony file, and nothing Desktop adds to the colony file reaches Home unless it is added here
//! first. Home never reads the colony file, and never writes anything but its answers.
//!
//! This crate is a draft kept beside Formiga Home until Desktop adopts it, the way Desktop's
//! `formiga-travel` is the contract Formiga Hill builds against. It is built on that crate where
//! the two say the same thing: a resident is drawn from the very [`formiga_travel::Traveler`] a
//! trip would carry, documents are written whole the same way, and text is made safe the same way.
//!
//! # A visit, file by file
//!
//! Everything for one visit lives in one session directory, named after its [`SessionId`]:
//!
//! | File | Written by | When |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`SNAPSHOT_FILE`] | Desktop | Before Home is started. Never changed afterwards. |
//! | [`STATE_FILE`] | Desktop | Before Home is started: the Home layouts Desktop last accepted. Never changed afterwards. |
//! | [`ACK_FILE`] | Home | Once Home has read both, saying whether it can host the household. |
//! | [`RESULT_FILE`] | Home | Whenever the owner finishes arranging, and once more on leaving: every layout as Home would have them, whole. The last one written is Home's answer. |
//! | [`RECEIPT_FILE`] | Home | When the owner leaves the house. |
//! | [`RECALL_FILE`] | Desktop | If Desktop ends the visit first. |
//!
//! Home is started with two arguments, [`LAUNCH_ARGUMENT`] and the session directory's absolute
//! path, and with nothing else. Every file is written whole to a temporary name and then renamed
//! into place, so a reader sees an old file, a new file, or no file, never half of one.
//!
//! Desktop reads Home's answers once Home has exited, or when it starts again and finds a visit
//! still open. Whatever goes wrong — Home missing, refusing, crashing, or writing something that
//! does not check out — the household goes back to living on the desktop, and the layouts Desktop
//! last accepted stay as they were. A result is applied only through [`accept_result`], which
//! keeps nothing Home may not change; a receipt can only add the small, fixed set of things in
//! [`HomeEffect`], and only those the snapshot's capabilities offer.
//!
//! # Versions
//!
//! Every document carries its `format`, the `version` it was written as, and the
//! `min_reader_version` a reader must understand to use it, read exactly as `formiga-travel`
//! reads its own: a reader accepts a document whose `min_reader_version` is at most
//! [`HOME_FORMAT_VERSION`], ignores fields it does not know, and refuses anything else with
//! [`HomeError::UnsupportedVersion`] rather than guessing. A snapshot also names the travel
//! version its residents are written in, and asks for a travel reader that can draw them.
//!
//! | Version | What it added |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1 | Everything |
//! | 2 | `visitors`: friends Desktop lends for the visit; `likings`: what each resident has come to like in its home |
//! | 3 | A room's `plan`, `kind` and `doors`: where each room stands in its house, what kind of room it is, and its doorways |
//!
//! The golden fixtures under `tests/fixtures` are every version as it was first written, and must
//! keep reading.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! Every document is size-limited before it is parsed, every list and string is bounded, and
//! every string is made safe when it is written and checked again when it is read. See
//! [`limits`].
